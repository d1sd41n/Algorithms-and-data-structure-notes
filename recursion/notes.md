# Recursion

## When to use it?
- When you can break a problem into similar sub-problems
- When you are fine with extra overhead (both time and space) that comes with it
- When you need a quick working solution instad of efficient one
- When you need to traverse a tree

## When avoid it?
- If time and space complexity matters for us
- Recursion uses more memory, if we use embedded memory, for example an app takes more memory un the phone is not efficient
- Recursion can be slow
